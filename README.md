# MySWN

This is a sample MySQL Database based upon Stars Without Numbers roleplaying game (If you're into sandbox pen-and-paper roleplaying game you should definitely check the game out: http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/?page_id=395 ) 

It was born from a need to create a testbed to train myself in MySQL query optimization-fu. 

The zip file hereby enclosed contains two SQL files:

* SWN_schema.sql -- creates the SQL Schema
* SWN_data.sql -- populates the DB.

These files are distributed under the "Do What You Want With It, Just Give Me Credit" license.
